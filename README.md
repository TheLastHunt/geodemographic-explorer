# geodemographic-explorer
This repository contains the code for the exploratory notebook and the dashboard application constructed for my Master's Thesis.

Due to github upload limit constraints, the data necessary to run the dashboard is not included in the repository.
To acess the data, click the following URL: https://mapas.ine.pt/download/index2021.phtml. It leads to INE's open-source Censos geopackage data.
There, acess the "Subsecções", meaning Subsections, version of the geopackaged data, and download only the data pertaining to the Lisbon Metropolitan Area.
Then, add the geopackge to the dashboard's "data" folder, and name it "mydata.gpkg".

If the data is included properly, the dashboard should run smoothly. Note that it does that a couple minutes to run locally.
